        <h2>Professional Experience:</h2>
        <p>I have over 4 years of experience in business development, with a proven track record of driving growth and building strong client relationships.</p>
        <p>I began my career as a Business Development Executive and was promoted to Business Development Manager within a year, recognizing my ability to deliver results. I then joined another IT firm as a Senior Business Development Manager, where I successfully established and led a high-performing team that generated significant new business.</p>
        <p>After a year in that role, I advanced to Operations Manager at my current company, where I continue to oversee strategic initiatives and contribute to organizational success.</p>
        <h3>New Journey in Front-End Web Development:</h3>
        <p>I have embarked on an exciting journey into front-end web development to expand my skill set and adapt to the evolving demands of the digital world. Enrolling in this course is a step toward equipping myself with the technical expertise to create visually engaging and user-friendly websites. My goal is to combine my experience in business development with my newfound skills in web development to deliver innovative solutions and add greater value to projects.</p>
